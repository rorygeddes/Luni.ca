This screen is for users to help out with the beginning phase. This is a spot where they can take a survey to help me create what the whole website is about. I want it to be a super simple clickable survey, with 10 simple questions about their financial history.

I then want a last section where they write down a problem, and another section of how they would want to fix their problem.

Someone off the internet can come and take a survey, and get automatically subscribed to the beta program where they can get early access to new updates and will stay in the know.
