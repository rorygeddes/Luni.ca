Fixes to the Home Screen

The headers buttons should be:
- Solutions (keep)
- Our Vision (not our story)
- Login (add it in, takes to a sign in with google)
- Join the Beta (keep to the survey)

Extend the header down to half the screen at the start, I also want the logo for luni larger. Same with the buttons too. 

I want it to say "Fix Your Money Problems"

Luni is an AI Financial System that  brings your money management systems all into one simple place. Now you can limit your financial stress and feel in control of your spending.

Track -> Split -> Plan
above the images instead

Track
Sync your bank accounts all in one place. Categorization made simple, with the help of Lun AI.

Split
No more 'who owes who?'. Create groups, assign spending, settle fast.

Plan
View your money in a new way to plan ahead. Create goals, follow through by staying consistent.

How it works?

Plaid API -> Connects with Your Bank -> Login in a trusted way -> View realtime updates without inputting manually
